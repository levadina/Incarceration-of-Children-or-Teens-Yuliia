				<p class="gallery-header1">Conclusion.</p>
				<p class="gallery-p1">In many prisons a child locked alone in a small empty room for many days is accepted practice. It sounds like child abuse but in prisons it is usual what is completely wrong. It also cause a lot of healthy traumas. <br><br>
				Before the Supreme Court banned the death penalty for juveniles in 2005, 366 people were executed for juvenile offenses. That ban allowed EJI to focus on some 3000 people who were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for offenses committed when they were 17 or younger. Children as young as 13 were among those condemned to die in prison. Over a thousand people who were automatically condemned to die in prison for juvenile offenses have been resentenced because of Miller, and hundreds have been released. <br><br>
				All in all, the most important thing is to teach our children justice from their childhood and do not help to build their lifes which are based on violence and injustice. </p> <br>

				<p class="Conclusion">Be kind and justice!</p>
